	started logging issues.
	tried to record today but ran into three or 4 issues.
	1. local bsv repo folder became empty for some reason.
	2. fetching from bsv to refill was unreliable
	3. the version of git on my system didn't like the contents of the repo
			^-- this is probably because I uploaded from Windows Ubuntu, likely has newer git.
	4. apparent packfile error: the upload is said to cost 44m satoshis, which is far too much.
		i thought I fixed that already.
	5. ./record is leaving processes open in the background after termination.  this is source of many bugs.

	- [X] update git on this system to prevent #3 in the future
		-> this didn't fix it.
		I'll debug.
	- [X] #3 is not properly diagnosed, and may have caused #2.  debug the git clone failures.
		I'm getting 'no such file or directory' when git is trying to write some of the files inside the .git/bsv folder.
		I tried shortening up the length of some of the path component names, and that strangely fixed it on the commandline, but it still fails inside the process.
		This appeared to be #5.
	- [X] debug #4
		packs are getting all squished together into a new pack again.
		looks like git is gc'ing on receive, need to make sure gc.auto=0 is set on repos cloned from before it was a thing, before they are received to.
		this appears to have fixed #4
		fix is in git-remote-bsv 1.4.8
