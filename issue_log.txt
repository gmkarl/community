	started logging issues.
	tried to record today but ran into three or 4 issues.
	1. local bsv repo folder became empty for some reason.
	2. fetching from bsv to refill was unreliable
	3. the version of git on my system didn't like the contents of the repo
			^-- this is probably because I uploaded from Windows Ubuntu, likely has newer git.
	4. apparent packfile error: the upload is said to cost 44m satoshis, which is far too much.
		i thought I fixed that already.

	- [X] update git on this system to prevent #3 in the future
		-> this didn't fix it.
		I'll debug.
	- [ ] #3 is not properly diagnosed, and may have caused #2.  debug the git clone failures.
	- [ ] debug #4
